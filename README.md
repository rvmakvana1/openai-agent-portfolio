# My OpenAI Agent Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of custom AI Assistants. This repository showcases powerful, autonomous agents I have built using OpenAI's Agent Builder, the Assistants API, and various external tools to interact with real-world applications.

## Project 1: Autonomous Gmail Agent (via Zapier)

### üìù Project Overview
This project is a powerful AI Assistant built directly on **OpenAI's Agent Builder platform**. This agent is designed to understand and execute complex, multi-step commands related to Gmail, using natural language. It functions as a true autonomous agent by interfacing with **Zapier's AI Actions (MCP) API** to get its "hands," allowing it to perform real-world tasks.

I successfully tested this agent by giving it sequential natural language commands like:
1.  "Find my last unread email."
2.  "Create a new label called 'Important-Follow-Up' and apply it to that email."
3.  "Now, draft a reply to that email saying 'Thank you, I will get back to you on this.'"

The agent was able to understand the context (like "that email") and execute all steps perfectly.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
* **OpenAI Agent Builder (Assistants API)**
* **GPT-5-nano Model** 
* **Zapier AI Actions (MCP API)**
* **Gmail** (as the target application via Zapier)

### ‚ú® Key Features
* **Natural Language Control:** The agent understands complex, multi-step commands from plain English, eliminating the need for a rigid workflow.
* **Autonomous Tool Chaining:** The agent intelligently decides which tool to use (e.g., `gmail_find_email` followed by `gmail_add_label_to_email`) and in what order to complete a request.
* **Real-World Action:** It can perform real-world actions like reading emails, creating labels, and sending replies without any step-by-step manual guidance.
* **Extreme Extensibility:** By using Zapier as the tool provider, this agent can be instantly given access to thousands of other apps (like Slack, Google Sheets, Airtable) by just adding more actions.

### üß† Challenges & Learnings
This project was a major step in understanding the future of automation. The key learning was the shift from *visual, step-by-step workflows* (like in n8n) to *instruction-based autonomous agents*. Instead of building the "how," the focus is now on providing the right instructions and the right tools. The agent itself figures out the 'workflow' on the fly. This is a much more powerful and flexible approach, truly defining the role of an "AI Agent & Automation Specialist."
